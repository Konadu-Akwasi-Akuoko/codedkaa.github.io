  <p>To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him
    mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and
    predominates the whole of her sex. </p>

  <p>It was not that he felt any emotion
    akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,
    were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.
    <br>He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that
    the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a
    false position.
    <br>He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
    and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for
    drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions.

    <b>But for the trained
      reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely

      instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not
      be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And
      yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene
      Adler, of dubious and questionable memory</b>

Ok so I think this is a preformated text.
But truthfully I don't know how this works.
     I will need to check my work after I have finish typing this.
I don't know how I can work with this text, it is so boring as hell.
        And tt us also bogus.</pre>
