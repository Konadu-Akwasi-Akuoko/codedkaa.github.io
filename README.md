Hello my name is Konadu Akwasi Akuoko.I got into tech through
game development at the age of 16. I built my own small games
following a tutorials by Brackeys, it was so fun. At that time
I didn't know how to write codes.

When I finished Senior High School, I decided to go to uni, I
went and study Information Technology, this was where I was
introduced to writing codes. We first learned how to write
pseudocodes, flow charts and algorithms. I was very interested
in it, and I decided to buy a course from gamedevHQ, I started
learning how to create scripts with C# and i can say it was the
best course to learn coding, all these while we have moved on to learned
C++ in Uni, but the course taught me C# and I found them very similar.

Our instructor is one of the best teachers I have gotten in my years
in the tech industry, and he is probably why I can learn in the Most
efficient way possible. He encouraged us not to watch the tutorials
and code along, but he taught us how to use Google to find answers,
understand the answer, and write your own code.

In his course you are given a task to complete in a first video, and
in the next video, he would walk you through how he solved the problem,
but the most important part is he does not use his knowledge to solve
the problem, but he begins the problem as if he is a beginner, thus
Googling for answers, and understanding the answer and implementing it.
All these while he was stressing how important is it to solve your, own
and compare yours to his. I followed how he was teaching religiously, by
working on the problem in the first video, and later comparing my answer
to his, and oh boy, I didn't know that, his type of learning could make
me master programming languages in a matter of days, he called his
learning style active learning, and how that is true!

Due to where I live and job opportunities, I needed to switch from
game development and focus on building web and mobile apps, and that is
why I created this repo to learn HTML.

I am still using the way we learn at gamedevHQ but I am modifying it a
little, for me I rather learn HTML at W3schools (it includes exercises
and quizzes, all for free, I made sure to work on all of them),
and after finishing, I would go to udemy and watch the tutorials about HTML,
if the instructor is coming to solve a problem, I would pause the video and
solve it on my own and later compare my answer to hers.

I know this will be a fun project, so you can follow along, and use my model
of learning to learn, and I can assure you it is one of the best. In This
repo I would create projects, which you can follow/visit the site. So let's
get started.
